## Easy upgrade

Run this command for the script to update itself.

$ autotag --upgrade
```

### With Git

If you cloned this repo, you can use Git to upgrade the script. e.g.

```sh
$ cd ~/repos/auto-tag
$ git pull
```


## Manual upgrade

Follow the _Download_ and _Change permissions_ steps in [Installation](installation) again.
