# ‚õµ Usage


## Note on fetching

As an added precaution, the tool will always fetch the _latest_ tags on the remote _before_ creating a tag. This is done to avoid accidentally creating a local tag that _already_ exists on the remote but is pointing to a different commit.


## Command-line usage

```
USAGE:
    autotag LEVEL [-p] [-u] [-h]

HELP:
    Increment git tag using given increment level.

    Positional arguments:
        LEVEL        : 'M' for major, 'm' for minor or 'b' for bug.

    Flags:
        -h --help    : Show help and exit.
        -p --preview : Do a dry run to show the new tag label only, without creating it.
                       This must be used as the 2nd arg i.e. after the LEVEL.
        -u --upgrade : Download latest script from GitHub, write over current script to
                       install it, then exit. Uses cURL and not Git. If using this flag,
                       not other options are needed or used.
```

As with tagging the normal way, it is recommended to be on the `master` branch before creating a tag. Otherwise, the tag may not be meaningful in a sequence (especially if the feature branch is behind `master`).


## Examples

### Create tags

Increment major version, minor version, or bug version respectively as follows:

```sh
$ autotag M
```
```sh
$ autotag m
```
```sh
$ autotag b
```

Output will be like this:

```console
$ ./autotag b
üöõ Fetching tags...
üîç Finding most recent tag...
üë¥ Last tag: v1.1.0
‚≠ê New tag: v1.1.1
```

### Preview

Use the preview flag:

```sh
$ autotag m -p
```
```
Auto tagging...
Last tag: v0.1.1
New tag: v0.2.0
Skipping tag creation
```

If there are no tags yet, then `v0.0.0` will be implied as the starting point for incrementing levels.

### Delete tag

If you realize you don't want that new tag anymore, delete it using `git`.

```sh
$ git tag -d TAG_NUMBER
```

### Push tag

If you are happy with the tag, you can push it. This will push _all_ local tags.

```sh
$ git push --tags
```

The command above will _not_ push the commits, so you should also do a standard push.

```sh
$ git push && git push --tags
```

### Upgrade

Get the latest version of AutoTag from GitHub.

If not installed with Git, you can run this command for the script to update itself.

```sh
$ ./autotag --upgrade
```

If you clone this repo somewhere, you can use it. e.g.

```sh
$ cd ~/repos/auto-tag
$ git pull
```
